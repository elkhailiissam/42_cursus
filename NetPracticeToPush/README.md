# NetPractice

## Description

This project is about configuring small networks to make them work. You get broken network diagrams and need to fix them by setting the right IP addresses, subnet masks, and routes so devices can communicate.

## Instructions

1. Download the project files from the 42 intranet page
2. Extract the files to any folder
3. Open index.html in Chrome or Chromium (Firefox doesn't work)
4. Enter your 42 login in the Training tab and click Start
5. Solve each level by filling in the empty fields
6. Click "Get my config" after completing each level to export your configuration
7. Place all 10 exported config files at the root of your Git repository

## Resources

Networking concepts studied:

- TCP/IP addressing - how IP addresses identify devices on a network
- Subnet mask - separates the network part from the host part of an IP
- Default gateway - the router address that lets you reach other networks
- Routers and switches - routers connect different networks, switches connect devices in the same network
- OSI layers - this project focuses on Layer 3 (Network layer)

AI usage:

I used AI to help me understand subnetting calculations and to explain why some configurations weren't working. All solutions were tested and understood before submitting.
